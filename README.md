# Team 3 Facial Recognition 

This project focuses mainly on the files "SignUpFaceId.py" and "LoginFaceIdRecognition.py"

The "SignUpFaceId.py" program registers the users face and stores it in a github repo

The "LoginFaceIdRecognition.py" then captures the user trying to login's face and compares it with the image stored in the github repo with that users username.
If the faces match, then the program returns true allowing the user to login. 
Else the program returns false and does not let the user log in.

This project is a very brief in depth view of scanning a users face and comparing it with a face stored.
